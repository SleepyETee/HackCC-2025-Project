# 🎃 How to Play: SpiderCalc Halloween Calculus Adventure

## 🎮 **Game Overview**

You are a **spider** on a Halloween adventure across a mathematical coordinate plane! Your goal: **jump forward** to reach the finish line by answering calculus questions correctly!

---

## 🕷️ **Gameplay Flow**

### **Step 1: Answer the Question** 👉
- Look at the **right panel** - there's a calculus question
- Press keys **1, 2, 3, or 4** to select your answer (or click)
- The question might ask about:
  - Derivatives (slopes)
  - Function values
  - Integrals (areas)
  - Graph interpretation

### **Step 2: Watch the Beams!** 📊
- As soon as you select an answer, **glowing beams** shoot from the spider to all targets
- **Orange beams** → Pumpkins (safe landing spots)
- **White beams** → Ghosts (dangerous spots)
- **Thicker beam** = Higher probability of jumping there

### **Step 3: Spider Prepares to Jump** 🟢
- After ~1 second, spider **glows GREEN**
- A **dotted trajectory arc** appears showing jump path
- A **pulsing target circle** shows most likely landing spot
- Bottom message says: **"🎯 Press SPACE to JUMP!"**

### **Step 4: JUMP!** 🚀
- Press **SPACE** or **ENTER** (or click Fire button)
- Spider **leaps through the air** in a parabolic arc
- Lands on a pumpkin or ghost (based on probability!)

### **Step 5: Score & Repeat** 🎯
- **Land on 🎃 Pumpkin:** +100 points (safe!)
- **Land on 👻 Ghost:** -100 points (penalty!)
- **Correct answer:** +150 bonus points
- New question loads → Repeat!

## 🎯 **Goal**

**Reach the FINISH LINE at x = 14!**
- Progress bar shows how far you've traveled
- Try to get there in the target number of jumps
- Maximize your score!

---

## 🧠 **How Answers Affect Jumps**

### ✅ **Correct Answer:**
- Pumpkins **under your equation line** get HIGH probability
- Spider more likely to jump to safe spots
- Forward progress favored!

### ❌ **Wrong Answer:**
- Ghosts get HIGHER probability
- Pumpkins get LOWER probability
- You might jump backward or hit dangers!

### 📐 **Equation Line Matters:**
Points **under the line** (y ≤ mx + b) are favored when you answer correctly!
- Adjust **m** (slope) to change line angle
- Adjust **b** (intercept) to move line up/down
- Or switch to **Quadratic/Sin/Exp** mode!

## 🎮 **Visual Feedback**

| What You See | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| 🟠 **Thick orange beam** | High chance to land on this pumpkin |
| ⚪ **Thin white beam** | Low chance to land on this ghost |
| 🟢 **Green glowing spider** | Ready to jump! |
| 🟣 **Purple spider** | Idle, waiting |
| **Percentage numbers** | Exact probability (e.g., "35%") |
| **Dotted arc** | Predicted jump trajectory |
| **Pulsing circle** | Most likely landing zone |

## 📐 **Calculus Teacher Controls**

Click buttons below the graph:

### **📐 Show Derivative (Tangent)**
- Displays a **green dashed line** tangent to the curve
- Shows **f'(x) value** (the slope at that point)
- **Teaching moment:** "See how the slope changes along the curve?"

### **📊 Show Integral (Area)**
- Displays **purple rectangles** under the curve (Riemann sums)
- Shows **∫f(x)dx** calculated value
- **Teaching moment:** "This is the area we're accumulating!"

## ⌨️ **Controls**

| Key/Button | Action |
|------------|--------|
| **1, 2, 3, 4** | Select answer A, B, C, or D |
| **Space** or **Enter** | Jump! (Fire grapple) |
| **Mouse** | Click buttons and sliders |
| **Sliders** | Adjust equation parameters |

## 🎯 **Strategy Tips**

1. **Adjust your equation** to make more pumpkins fall "under the line"
2. **Think before answering** - wrong answers lead to ghosts!
3. **Watch the beams** - they show your probability distribution
4. **Aim for thick beams** - those are your best bets
5. **Build combos** - 3+ correct answers = bonus multiplier!

---

## 🏆 **Winning**

Complete the level by:
- ✅ Reaching the finish line (x = 14+)
- ✅ Using your target number of jumps
- ✅ Maximizing your score
- ✅ Building combo streaks!

**Level Complete screen** shows your final score and celebrates with fireworks! 🎆

## 👩‍🏫 **For Teachers**

### **How to Use in Class:**

1. **Project on screen** - Students see the graph together
2. **Call on students** to answer questions
3. **Toggle derivative/integral** to demonstrate concepts
4. **Pause and discuss** - "Why did the spider jump there?"
5. **Compare strategies** - Different equations yield different results!

### **Discussion Prompts:**
- "Why are pumpkins under the line more likely?"
- "What happens when we increase the slope?"
- "How does probability relate to math correctness?"
- "Can you predict where the spider will land?"
