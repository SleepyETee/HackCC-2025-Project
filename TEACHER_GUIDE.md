## Learning Outcomes

### LO1: Linear Functions & Inequalities
**Standards:** Algebra I/II, Common Core HSA-CED.A.3, HSF-IF.C.7a

Students will:
- Calculate slope between two points using the formula (y₂-y₁)/(x₂-x₁)

**In-Game Application:** Students adjust line parameters and see immediate visual feedback showing which anchors satisfy the inequality constraint.

---

### LO2: Function Recognition & Evaluation
**Standards:** Common Core HSF-IF.C.7, HSF-BF.B.3

Students will:
- Recognize characteristic shapes of functions:
  - Linear (y = mx + b) - straight line

  - Exponential (y = eˣ) - rapid growth curve
- Evaluate functions at specific points
- Match functions to their graphical representations
- Understand domain and range concepts

**In-Game Application:** Students select different curve modes and observe how anchors close to the curve are favored in the probability distribution.

---

### LO3: Introduction to Calculus Concepts

**In-Game Application:** Questions ask students to find derivatives at specific points, helping them see the connection between the curve and its slope.

---

### LO4: Probability & Statistics
**Standards:** Common Core HSS-MD.A.1, HSS-MD.A.2, AP Statistics

Students will:
- Understand probability distributions and how they're visualized
- Recognize that probabilities must sum to 1
- Build intuition for expected value (weighted average outcomes)
- Understand entropy as a measure of uncertainty
- Connect confidence in predictions to distribution spread
- Make strategic decisions under uncertainty

**In-Game Application:** 
- Beam thickness/brightness shows probability weights
- Correct answers concentrate probability on favorable anchors
- Students see real-time sampling from their created distribution
- Entropy affects confidence bonus scores

## Game Mechanics (For Teachers)

### Core Loop
1. **Adjust Equation:** Students use sliders to set line parameters or select a curve type
2. **Answer Question:** Multiple-choice question related to current mathematical concept
3. **Observe Probability Field:** Beams show probability distribution based on:
   - Answer correctness
   - Whether anchors satisfy the equation constraint
   - Distance from the curve (in curve mode)
   - Anchor safety (hazards have lower probability when correct)
4. **Fire Grapple:** Spider samples one anchor from the distribution and moves there
5. **Score & Progress:** Points awarded based on anchor type, correctness, progress, and confidence

### Scoring System

#### Base Score
- Safe anchor: +100
- Hazard anchor: -100

#### Bonuses
- **Progress Bonus:** Up to +80 points for forward movement
- **Correctness Bonus:** +150 for correct answers
- **Confidence Bonus:** Up to +60 based on entropy (lower entropy = higher bonus)
- **Combo Multiplier:** ×1.5 after 3+ correct answers in a row

This rewards both correctness AND strategic thinking about probability distributions.

## Level Breakdown

### Tutorial: Linear Basics
**Duration:** 5 pulls (questions)
**Concepts:** Slope calculation, intercept, linear inequalities, slope interpretation
**Curve Mode:** Line (y = mx + b)

**Sample Questions:**
- What is the slope between points (0,0) and (2,4)? → Tests slope formula
- For y = 2x + 3, what is the y-intercept? → Tests understanding of b parameter
- Which point satisfies y ≤ x + 1? → Tests inequality evaluation

**Teaching Tips:**
- Encourage students to predict which anchors will light up before answering
- Have them adjust the line parameters and observe the preview
- Discuss why lower entropy (more confident distributions) earn bonus points

---

### Level 1: Linear Launch
**Duration:** 4 pulls
**Concepts:** Lines from two points, inequality gating, probability mechanics
**Curve Mode:** Line

**Key Learning Moments:**
- Students must find which line passes through given points
- Understanding that "under the line" means y ≤ mx + b gets boosted probability
- Seeing how correct answers favor safe anchors under the line

**Discussion Questions:**
- "Why did the spider have a high chance of hitting that anchor?"
- "How would changing the slope affect which anchors are reachable?"
- "What happens to the probability distribution when you answer incorrectly?"

---

### Level 2: Curve Fit
**Duration:** 4 pulls
**Concepts:** Quadratic evaluation, derivatives, function recognition, trigonometric properties
**Curve Mode:** Quadratic (y = x²)

**Key Learning Moments:**
- Students evaluate f(x) = x² at specific points
- Introduction to derivatives: f'(x) = 2x
- Visual connection between parabola shape and anchor favorability
- Distinguishing between different function families

**Extension Activities:**
- Have students sketch the parabola on paper before seeing it in-game
- Compare how many anchors fall "close" to different curve types
- Discuss why f'(1) = 2 for f(x) = x² using the limit definition

---

### Level 3: Risk & Reward
**Duration:** 3 pulls
**Concepts:** Entropy/uncertainty, expected value, strategic decision-making, game mechanics
**Curve Mode:** Line (back to basics with advanced strategy)

**Key Learning Moments:**
- Understanding entropy as a measure of distribution spread
- Balancing risk (hazards) vs. reward (forward progress)
- Making strategic choices about which answers might give better distributions
- Combo multiplier strategy

**Discussion Questions:**
- "Would you prefer a 50% chance at a far anchor or 90% chance at a near anchor?"
- "How does entropy relate to confidence in your grapple target?"
- "What's the expected value of your score this turn?"

## Classroom Implementation Strategies

### Individual Play (15-20 min)
1. **Warm-up (2 min):** Review slope, intercept, and probability basics
2. **Tutorial Level (5 min):** Students complete with note-taking on concepts
3. **Main Levels (10 min):** Students progress through Levels 1-3
4. **Debrief (3 min):** Class discussion on strategies and math connections

### Paired/Group Play (25-30 min)
- **Think-Pair-Share:** One student controls equation, other answers questions
- **Strategy Discussion:** Groups debate which equation settings optimize score
- **Probability Prediction:** Before each fire, predict which anchor is most likely

### Homework/Asynchronous Learning
- Students complete levels independently
- Screenshot interesting probability distributions
- Journal: "What strategy gave you the highest score?"
- Challenge: Beat target scores for each level

---

## Assessment Opportunities

### Formative Assessment
- **Observation:** Watch students adjust equations—do they understand the effect?
- **Questioning:** "Why did you choose that slope value?"
- **Self-Explanation:** Have students narrate their thought process

### Summative Assessment Ideas
1. **Probability Distribution Worksheet:** Given an equation and anchors, draw expected beams
2. **Function Identification:** Match curve previews to function equations
3. **Strategic Analysis:** Explain why certain answers produce better distributions
4. **Derivative Application:** Calculate f'(x) for various functions and explain meaning

### Learning Analytics (Built-in)
- **Score:** Indicates overall success
- **Combo Counter:** Shows sustained understanding
- **Pulls Remaining:** Teaches pacing and strategy
- **Concept Tags:** Each question tagged with specific concept

---

## Common Student Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: "I don't understand why the beams change"
**Solution:** Pause after one question and explicitly trace:
- "You answered correctly, so safe anchors under the line get boosted"
- "Look at this anchor—it's safe and under the line. See the bright beam?"
- Have them predict beam brightness before revealing

### Challenge 2: "The spider didn't go where I wanted"
**Solution:** Emphasize probability vs. certainty:
- "The beams show *probability*, not *guarantee*"
- "Thicker beams = more likely, but still random"
- Relate to real-world: weather forecasts, game drop rates

### Challenge 3: "How do I get a higher confidence bonus?"
**Solution:** Connect to entropy:
- "More concentrated distribution = lower entropy = higher confidence"
- "Compare: all beams equal (low bonus) vs. one thick beam (high bonus)"
- "Correct answers + good equation choices = concentrated distribution"

### Challenge 4: "Derivatives are confusing"
**Solution:** Use the visual curve:
- "The derivative is the *slope* of the curve at one point"
- "For f(x) = x², the curve gets steeper as x increases"
- "f'(1) = 2 means the tangent line at x=1 has slope 2"
- Draw tangent lines on paper alongside the screen
