## 📊 **Assessment Ideas**

### **Formative Assessment:**
1. **Screenshot Challenge:** "Take a screenshot showing f'(2) = 4"
2. **Coordinate Hunt:** "Move spider to (3, 9) on y = x²"
3. **Estimation:** "Estimate the integral from 0 to 3"
4. **Prediction:** "Before clicking, predict: will the tangent be steep or flat?"

### **Discussion Prompts:**
- "Why does the derivative change as we move along the curve?"
- "What does the area under the curve represent in a real-world scenario?"
- "How accurate are our Riemann sums? How could we improve?"

### **Extension Activities:**
- **Create Your Own:** "Design a function where f'(x) = 0 at three points"
- **Derivative Detective:** "Find where the curve has maximum slope"
- **Integral Comparison:** "Which function has larger area from 0 to 5?"
