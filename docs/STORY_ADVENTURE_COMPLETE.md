## 🚀 How to Play

### Starting the Game:

1. Click "🎮 Adventure Mode" button (if in classic mode)
2. Click "📖 Story Adventure" button (if in classic adventure)
3. Read the story panel to understand your mission
4. Wait for a question to appear

### Playing Through a Scene:

1. **Read the Question** - Understand what it's asking
2. **Look at the Icons** - See if it's a jump (🦘) or web (🕸️) question
3. **Answer the Question** - Click one of 4 options
4. **Watch Your Spider Act** - See the result of your answer:
   - ✅ Correct = Strong, precise action
   - ❌ Wrong = Weak, inaccurate action
5. **Navigate to Goal** - Use jump/web mechanics to reach green 🎯 marker
6. **Repeat** - Continue answering questions until you reach the goal

### Scene Progression:

- Complete a scene → Automatically load next scene
- Complete Chapter 1 → Unlock Chapter 2
