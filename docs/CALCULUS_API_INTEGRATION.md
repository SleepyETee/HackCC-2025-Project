# 📚 Calculus API Integration - Complete Documentation

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Timer Errors - FIXED**
- ✅ Created proper `cleanupTimer()` method
- ✅ Timer is now cleaned up in shutdown
- ✅ Timer is cleaned up before creating new one
- ✅ Timer is cleaned up when web is cut
- ✅ Double-check web attachment before auto-release
- ✅ Set timer to undefined after removal

**Result:** No more timer errors! Proper lifecycle management.

## 📖 Calculus API System

### **Based on: Calculus Volume 1 Textbook Structure**

The API follows standard Calculus Volume 1 chapter organization:

#### **Chapter Mapping by Height:**

| Height Range | Chapter | Topics Covered |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| **0-300m** | Foundations | Functions, Graphs, Basic Concepts |
| **300-600m** | Limits | Limits, Continuity, Asymptotes |
| **600-1200m** | Derivatives | Power Rule, Product Rule, Quotient Rule |
| **1200-1800m** | Applications | Chain Rule, Implicit Diff, Related Rates, Optimization |
| **1800-2400m** | Integration | Integrals, Fundamental Theorem, Substitution |
| **2400-3000m** | Advanced | Integration by Parts, Partial Fractions |

## 🎯 Progressive Difficulty System

### **Height-Based Question Selection**

Questions are automatically selected based on spider's current height:

```typescript
const question = getQuestionByHeight(currentHeight)
```

**How it works:**
1. Game tracks spider's height (0-3000m)
2. Each question has a `recommendedHeight` property
3. Questions within ±400m of current height are eligible
4. Random selection from appropriate question pool
5. Difficulty naturally increases as you climb

### **Difficulty Levels:**
- **Easy** (0-600m): Basic limits, simple derivatives
- **Medium** (600-1800m): Product rule, chain rule, optimization
- **Hard** (1800-2700m): Integration techniques, substitution
- **Expert** (2700-3000m): Integration by parts, complex chain rule

## 🎮 Game Integration

### **Automatic Question Loading**

Questions are requested at 3 key moments:

1. **Before Web Shot** - Every time web releases
2. **Mid-Swing** - Random 0.3% chance per frame while swinging
3. **At Checkpoints** - When passing 500m markers

### **Question Format Conversion**

Calculus API questions are automatically converted to game format:

```typescript
// Calculus API Question
{
  question: "What is d/dx [x³]?",
  options: [
    { text: "A) 3x²", correct: true, explanation: "..." }
  ],
  hint: "Use the power rule",
  concept: "Power rule for derivatives"
}

// Converts to Game Format
{
  text: "What is d/dx [x³]?",
  options: [
    { text: "A) 3x²", correct: true, action: 'web' }
  ],
  storyContext: "The Derivative | medium difficulty at 850m"
}
```

## 🔧 API Functions

### **Core Functions:**

#### `getQuestionByHeight(height: number): CalculusQuestion`
Returns appropriate question for current height.

**Example:**
```typescript
const question = getQuestionByHeight(1500) 
// Returns chain rule or optimization question
```

#### `getChapterByHeight(height: number)`
Returns chapter info for current height.

**Example:**
```typescript
const chapter = getChapterByHeight(1500)
// Returns: { name: 'derivativeApplications', description: 'Applications of Derivatives' }
```

#### `getDifficultyMultiplier(height: number): number`
Calculates score multiplier based on height.

**Example:**
```typescript
const multiplier = getDifficultyMultiplier(1500)
// Returns: 2.0 (at 1500m = 2x multiplier)
```

---

## 📈 Statistics & Scoring

### **Height-Based Scoring:**
- 0m = 1.0x multiplier
- 1500m = 2.0x multiplier
- 3000m = 3.0x multiplier

### **Question Distribution:**
```
0-300m:   2 questions  (11.8%)
300-600m: 2 questions  (11.8%)
600-1200m: 3 questions (17.6%)
