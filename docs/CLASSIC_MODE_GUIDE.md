# 🎮 Classic Mode - Complete Guide

## 🎯 **OBJECTIVE**

Guide your spider from the **starting position (x = 0)** to the **FINISH LINE (x = 14)** using strategic calculus knowledge and probability mechanics!

---

## 📖 **HOW TO PLAY**

### **Step-by-Step Gameplay:**

1. **📝 Answer the Calculus Question**
   - Read the question in the right panel
   - Select one of the four answer options (A, B, C, or D)
   - Answers are shuffled each time!

2. **📊 Observe Probability Beams**
   - After selecting an answer, glowing beams appear
   - Beams show the probability of reaching each anchor point
   - Thicker beam = Higher probability
   - **Orange beams** → Pumpkins (safe!)
   - **White beams** → Ghosts (danger!)

3. **🚀 Fire Your Grapple**
   - Click the **"🚀 FIRE!"** button in the top-left
   - Or press **SPACE** or **ENTER** key
   - Spider shoots web and jumps to a random anchor based on probability

4. **🎃 Land and Score**
   - Spider lands on an anchor point
   - Score updates based on:
     - **🎃 Pumpkin**: +100 points (safe landing!)
     - **✅ Correct answer**: +50 bonus points
     - **👻 Ghost**: -150 points (hazard!)
   - Build **3+ combos** for multipliers!

5. **🔄 Repeat**
   - New question automatically loads
   - Continue until you reach the finish line or run out of pulls

## 🧠 **STRATEGIC ELEMENTS**

### **Equation Curve Control**

- **Line Mode (y = mx + b)**: Adjust slope `m` and y-intercept `b`
- **Other Modes**: Quadratic, Sine Wave, Exponential

**KEY STRATEGY:**  
Points **UNDER the curve/line** are "safe zones" when you answer correctly!

- Adjust the curve to make more pumpkins fall "under the line"
- When you answer correctly, pumpkins under the line get a **3.0× probability boost**
- This gives you strategic control over where the spider is likely to land

### **Probability Distribution**

The game uses **softmax probability** based on:

1. **Forward Progress** (1.5× multiplier):
   - Points further to the right (closer to finish) are favored

2. **Answer Correctness**:
   - ✅ **Correct**: Pumpkins under line get +3.0 bonus
   - ❌ **Wrong**: Ghosts get +1.5 bonus, pumpkins get -1.0 penalty

3. **Point Type**:
   - Pumpkins are naturally safer
   - Ghosts have inherent risk

## 🏆 **SCORING SYSTEM**

| Event | Points | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Land on 🎃 Pumpkin | +100 | Safe landing |
| Correct Answer Bonus | +50 | When landing on pumpkin |
| Land on 👻 Ghost | -150 | Hazard penalty |
| **3+ Correct Streak** | Combo! | Score multiplier shown |

## 🎯 **WIN CONDITIONS**

### ✅ **Victory**
- Spider reaches **x ≥ 14** (crosses the finish line)
- Shows victory message with final score
- **Auto-advances to next round**
- Complete all 10 rounds to become a **Calculus Master!** 🧙‍♂️

### ❌ **Failure**
- Run out of pulls before reaching finish line
- Shows failure message
- **Auto-restarts current round** with fresh pulls
- Score resets to 0

## 🎓 **EDUCATIONAL FEATURES**

### **Calculus Visualization Tools:**

- **📐 Show Derivative (Tangent)**: 
  - Displays tangent line at a point
  - Shows f'(x) value in real-time
  - Teaches instantaneous rate of change

- **📊 Show Integral (Area)**:
  - Visualizes Riemann sum rectangles
  - Calculates approximate area under curve
  - Teaches integration concept

## 💡 **TIPS FOR SUCCESS**

1. **Read Questions Carefully**: Answers are shuffled, so read each option!

2. **Adjust Your Curve**: Before answering, position the curve to maximize pumpkins in the "safe zone"

3. **Think Strategically**: 
   - Need to reach far? Risk it with a challenging curve position
   - Playing safe? Position curve to favor nearby pumpkins

4. **Watch the Beams**: The visualization shows your probability distribution before you commit

5. **Build Combos**: 3+ correct answers in a row gives you a multiplier!

6. **Study the Concepts**: Each round teaches a specific calculus topic - learn as you play!
