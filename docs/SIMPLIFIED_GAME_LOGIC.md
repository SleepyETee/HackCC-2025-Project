# 🎮 Simplified Game Logic - Crystal Clear!

## ✅ Core Game Mechanic (Simple & Direct)

### **THE BASIC LOOP:**

```
1. Spider waits at current height
2. Question appears on right panel
3. Player hovers pumpkin → Preview golden line appears
4. Player clicks pumpkin → Commits to that choice
5. Player answers question on right
   
   IF CORRECT ✅:
   → Spider shoots web to pumpkin
   → Spider climbs UP to that pumpkin
   → Gain height (+150m, +200m, or +250m)
   → Score +100
   
   IF WRONG ❌:
   → Spider falls DOWN 200m
   → Lose score -50
   → Lose 1 life
   
6. New pumpkins appear
7. New question appears
8. Repeat until 3000m or 0 lives
```

## 🎯 Math → Movement Connection (Direct!)

### **Clear Cause & Effect:**

| Math Answer | Spider Action | Height Change | Score | Lives |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------|-------|
| ✅ **CORRECT** | Climb UP to pumpkin | +150/200/250m | +100 | Same |
| ❌ **WRONG** | Fall DOWN | -200m | -50 | -1 |

**NO complex physics, NO confusing timers, NO random events!**

---

## 🎃 Pumpkin System (Simple Choice)

### **3 Pumpkins Always Available:**

Each turn, player sees 3 pumpkins:
- **Left pumpkin:** +150m (safe, small gain)
- **Center pumpkin:** +200m (medium gain)
- **Right pumpkin:** +250m (risky, big gain)

**Strategy:**
- Need big height? Pick right pumpkin (but if wrong, fall hurts more!)
- Play safe? Pick left pumpkin (smaller reward)
- Balanced? Pick center

---

## 📝 Question Integration

### **Questions Scale with Height:**

| Height Range | Calculus Chapter | Difficulty |
|--------------|------------------|------------|
| **0-300m** | Functions & Graphs | Easy |
| **300-600m** | Limits | Easy-Medium |
| **600-1200m** | Derivatives | Medium |
| **1200-1800m** | Chain Rule & Applications | Medium-Hard |
| **1800-2400m** | Integration | Hard |
| **2400-3000m** | Advanced Integration | Expert |

**Example at 1500m:**
```
Question: "What is d/dx [(x² + 1)³]?"
Options: A) 6x(x² + 1)²  ✅
         B) 3(x² + 1)²   ❌
         C) 6x²(x² + 1)² ❌
         D) 3x²(x² + 1)² ❌

Player clicks center pumpkin (+200m)
Player selects A (correct!)
→ Spider climbs to pumpkin (1500m → 1700m)
→ Score +100
```

## 💾 Checkpoint System (Simple Safety Net)

### **Checkpoints Every 500m:**
- 0m (start)
- 500m
- 1000m
- 1500m
- 2000m
- 2500m

**What checkpoints do:**
- Save your progress
- Visual marker (golden platform)
- Nothing else! (No special bonuses, just progress tracking)

---

## ❤️ Lives System (Clear & Fair)

### **Start: 3 Lives**

**Lose a life when:**
- Answer WRONG → Fall 200m + Lose 1 life

**Game Over:**
- Lives reach 0
- Options: RETRY or MENU

**Lives DON'T decrease when:**
- Answering correctly (you only climb)
- Just existing in game
- Hitting checkpoints

---

## 🎯 Victory Condition (Simple!)

**Reach 3000m height = WIN!**

That's it. No time limits, no complex conditions.

---

## 🚫 What Was REMOVED (Simplified!)

### **Old Complex Physics:**
- ❌ Pendulum swing mechanics
- ❌ Auto-release timers
- ❌ Web tension calculations
- ❌ Gravity constantly pulling
- ❌ Multiple anchor choices
- ❌ Mid-swing questions
- ❌ Hazards cutting webs
- ❌ Moving obstacles

### **New Simple Logic:**
- ✅ Click pumpkin
- ✅ Answer question
- ✅ Go UP or DOWN
- ✅ Clear feedback

---

## 🎨 Visual Enhancements with Three.js

### **Three.js Integration (Installed):**

```bash
✓ three - Core 3D library
✓ @types/three - TypeScript support
```

### **Planned 3D Enhancements:**

1. **3D Spider Model**
   - Volumetric body instead of flat ellipse
   - Realistic leg joints
   - Smooth animations

2. **3D Pumpkin Models**
   - Carved depth effect
   - Rotating stems
   - Shadow and lighting

3. **3D Web Strands**
   - Thickness variation
   - Reflective material
   - Particle effects

4. **3D Background**
   - Depth parallax
   - Atmospheric fog
   - Dynamic lighting

5. **Camera Effects**
   - Depth of field
   - Motion blur on climbs/falls
   - Cinematic angles

- Wrong answer = Immediate consequence (fall down!)
- Students see direct impact of their knowledge

### **Strategic Thinking:**
- Choose pumpkin height based on confidence
- Risk vs reward on each question
- Checkpoint safety net encourages learning

### **Progress Visualization:**
- Height number shows learning progress
- Checkpoints show milestones
- Score reflects overall performance

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **State Variables (Clean!):**

```typescript
currentHeight: number    // 0-3000m
lives: number           // 3 at start
score: number           // Points earned
isAnimating: boolean    // Prevent input during climb/fall
gameActive: boolean     // Game not over
```

### **Key Functions:**

1. **`generatePumpkinChoices()`**
   - Creates 3 pumpkins at different heights
   - Always above spider's current position
   - Clear height gain labels

2. **`handleAnswer(correct: boolean)`**
   - IF correct: Call `climbToPumpkin()`
   - IF wrong: Call `fallDown()`
   - That's it!

3. **`climbToPumpkin(pumpkin)`**
   - Show web animation
   - Tween spider to pumpkin.y
   - Update currentHeight
   - Check victory/checkpoint
   - Continue game

4. **`fallDown()`**
   - Lose 1 life
   - Fall 200m down
   - Update height
   - Check game over
   - Continue or end
