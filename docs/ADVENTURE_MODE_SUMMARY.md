# 🕷️ SpiderCalc Adventure Mode - Complete Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a **full adventure mode** for SpiderCalc! The game now features two distinct modes:
- **🎮 Adventure Mode** (NEW) - Story-driven platformer with calculus puzzles
- **📊 Classic Mode** - Original graph-based probability gameplay

## 🎭 The Adventure Story

**Title:** *"The Calculus Chronicles: Spider's Quest"*

**Synopsis:** A brave spider mathematician must navigate through the Haunted Mansion of Functions to recover the legendary Derivative Crown, solving calculus puzzles to jump gaps and shoot webs across treacherous halls.

### Four Epic Chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: The Entrance Hall** - Master basic derivatives
2. **Chapter 2: The Integral Library** - Unlock integration secrets
3. **Chapter 3: The Chamber of Limits** - Navigate precise limit calculations
4. **Chapter 4: The Throne Room** - Face the final calculus challenge

## 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics

### Spider Actions (Controlled by Answer Type)

Each question has options tagged as either **JUMP** 🦘 or **WEB** 🕸️:

#### Jump Mechanics
- **Trigger:** Answering jump-type questions
- **Correct Answer:** Strong forward leap with high arc
- **Wrong Answer:** Weaker jump, less distance
- **Physics:** Parabolic trajectory with gravity
- **Use Case:** Crossing gaps, reaching platforms

#### Web Shooting Mechanics
- **Trigger:** Answering web-type questions
- **Correct Answer:** Accurate aim to closest web point
- **Wrong Answer:** Limited range, may miss
- **Physics:** Pendulum swing motion when attached
- **Use Case:** Swinging across large distances, reaching high points

### Platformer Elements

- **Platforms:** Safe landing spots
- **Gaps:** Must jump over or fall
- **Walls:** Obstacles with mystical runes (∫, ∂, Σ, π, ∞)
- **Web Points:** Golden anchor points for web shooting (marked with 🕸️)
- **Goal Markers:** End point for each scene (🎯 GOAL)

## 📝 Question System

### Story-Integrated Questions

Questions are contextually tied to the adventure:
- **Jump Questions:** Focus on derivatives, motion, slopes
  - "To calculate the jump trajectory, what is the derivative of position?"
  - "If position is s(t) = 5t², what is velocity at t = 2?"
  
- **Web Questions:** Focus on angles, vectors, trigonometry
  - "To shoot web at correct angle, calculate: sin(30°)?"
  - "Calculate web length to point (3,4) from origin"

Each question includes:
- **Story context** - How it relates to the adventure
- **Hint** - Educational support
- **Concept tag** - Learning objective
- **Action icons** - Visual indicators (🦘 or 🕸️)
