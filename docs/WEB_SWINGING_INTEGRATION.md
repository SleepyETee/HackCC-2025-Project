# üï∑Ô∏è Web-Swinging Mode Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated the Spider-Man web-swinging adventure mode into the Story Adventure Mode with a custom UI.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified/Created

#### 1. `src/ui/SpiderManWebSwinging.tsx` (NEW)
- Standalone React component with full game implementation
- Uses Phaser.js for physics-based web-swinging mechanics
- Features 5 scenes across 4 chapters
- Custom UI built inline with the component

#### 2. `src/state/store.ts` (MODIFIED)
- Added `'web-swinging'` as a third adventure mode option
- Updated type definitions to support the new mode

#### 3. `src/App.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- Imported SpiderManWebSwinging component
- Added "üï∑Ô∏è Web-Swinging" button to adventure mode selector
- Updated subtitle text for web-swinging mode
- Added conditional rendering for full-screen web-swinging mode
- Hid instructions panel when in web-swinging mode (since it has its own UI)

## How It Works

### Navigation
1. Click **"üéÆ Adventure Mode"** button
2. Select **"üï∑Ô∏è Web-Swinging"** from the adventure mode selector
3. The game renders full-screen with its own UI

### Game Features

#### Controls
- **Left Click + Drag**: Aim and shoot web to anchor points
- **Right Click**: Cut nearest web to free the spider
- **Trajectory Preview**: Yellow line shows where the web will travel

#### Question Types
- **ü¶ò JUMP Questions**: Enable jumping mechanics (gravity-based physics)
- **üï∏Ô∏è WEB Questions**: Enable web-shooting mechanics

#### Physics Effects
- **Correct Answer**: Gravity = 600 (easier movement)
- **Wrong Answer**: Gravity = 1000 (harder movement)

#### Scenes
1. **Chapter 1 - The Great Gap**: Cross the entrance gap
2. **Chapter 1 - The Chandelier Crossing**: Swing across the grand hall
3. **Chapter 2 - The Towering Shelves**: Climb library shelves
4. **Chapter 3 - The Precipice**: Navigate narrow ledges
5. **Chapter 4 - The Throne Room**: Claim the Derivative Crown

### UI Components

The component includes:
- **Game Canvas**: Phaser.js game rendering
- **Control Instructions**: Top-left of game area
- **Question Panel**: Right side with:
  - Story context badge
  - Question and multiple choice answers
  - Concept and hint information
  - Score display
  - Action legend

## Technical Details

### Unique Container ID
To avoid conflicts with other Phaser instances, the web-swinging mode uses its own container:
- Container ID: `web-swinging-container`
- This prevents ID collisions with other game modes

### Event System
Uses the same event system as other adventure modes:
- `request-question`: Requests questions from the game
- `spidercalc-answer`: Submits answers with correct/incorrect status

### Styling
All styles are inline React styles, making the component completely self-contained. Colors used:
- Primary: `#8b5cf6` (Purple)
- Success: `#00ff00` (Green)
- Warning: `#ffd700` (Gold)
- Background: `#1a1a2e` (Dark blue)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add sound effects for web shooting and cuts
2. Add particle effects for web connections
3. Add more complex physics interactions
4. Add achievements/scores persistence
5. Add multiplayer support
6. Add more scenes and chapters

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Button appears in adventure mode selector
- [x] Clicking button switches to web-swinging mode
- [x] Game canvas renders correctly
- [x] Questions appear and can be answered
- [x] Physics responds to correct/wrong answers
- [x] Web shooting works with trajectory preview
- [x] Web cutting works with right-click
- [x] Level progression works
- [x] No console errors
- [x] No ID conflicts with other game modes

## Notes

The web-swinging mode is completely self-contained and does not conflict with existing game modes. It's positioned as an alternative story-driven adventure experience that focuses on web physics and calculus-based problem-solving.
