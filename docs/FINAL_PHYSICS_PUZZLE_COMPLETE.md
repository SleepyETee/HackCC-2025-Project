## 🕷️ **SPIDER DESIGN**

### **Cute Spider (Same as Classic Adventure!)**
```
Features:
- 🖤 Black ellipse body
- 👀 Big white eyes with red pupils
- ✨ Shine effects on eyes
- 🦵 8 curved legs (4 per side)
- 🔄 Rotates based on velocity when flying
```

### **Visual Polish:**
- Body highlight (3D effect)
- Smooth rotation during flight
- Returns to upright when on slingshot

---

## ⚙️ **PHYSICS IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Matter.js Settings:**
```typescript
Spider Body:
- Radius: 15px
- Restitution: 0.4 (bouncy)
- Friction: 0.1 (slight)
- Air friction: 0.01 (realistic drag)
- Density: 0.001 (light spider!)

Rope Constraints:
- Stiffness: 0.4 (elastic, fun swinging!)
- Damping: 0.05 (gradual energy loss)
- Auto-attach radius: 80px
- Multiple ropes: Yes!

Launch Physics:
- Power: 0.025x drag distance
- Max drag: 150px
- Trajectory: Parabolic with gravity
```

---

## 🎮 **COMPLETE GAMEPLAY LOOP**

### **1. Aiming Phase**
```
- Spider sits on slingshot (100, 500)
- Player clicks and drags spider backward
- Slingshot bands stretch (brown elastic bands)
- Yellow trajectory dots show predicted path
- Max drag: 150 pixels from slingshot
```

### **2. Launch Phase**
```
- Player releases mouse
- Spider launches with velocity = drag * 0.025
- Slingshot disappears
- Spider rotates based on flight direction
- Trajectory clears
```

### **3. Flight Phase**
```
- Spider flies through air (parabolic motion)
- Gravity: 1 unit/frame
- Air friction: 0.01
- Bounces off platforms (0.4 restitution)
```

### **4. Auto-Attach Phase**
```
- When within 80px of rope anchor
- Matter.js creates rope constraint automatically
- Visual rope line appears (white, 3px wide)
- Spider swings like pendulum
- Multiple ropes can attach!
```

### **5. Rope Cutting Phase**
```
- Player clicks near rope midpoint (25px radius)
- Rope fades out (200ms animation)
- Matter.js constraint removed
- Spider continues flying/falling
```

### **6. Collection Phase**
```
- Stars: Within 30px → Collect!
  - Zoom animation (scale 2x)
  - Fade out
  - Flash effect
  - Score updates
  
- Goal: Within 50px → Win!
  - Completion screen
  - Star rating
  - Restart button
```

### **7. Reset Phase**
```
- If spider falls off screen (y > 700)
- All ropes cut
- Spider returns to slingshot
- Velocity reset to 0
- Ready for new launch
```

## 🎨 **VISUAL DESIGN**

### **Color Palette:**
```
Background:     Dark purple gradient (#1a0a1a → #0a0015)
Spider:         Black with red eyes
Platforms:      Purple (#8b5cf6) with darker border
Rope Anchors:   Gold (#ffd700) with orange glow
Ropes:          White (#ffffff, 70% opacity)
Stars:          Gold (#ffd700) with orange glow
Goal:           Green (#00ff00, pulsing)
Slingshot:      Brown (#8b4513)
Trajectory:     Yellow (#ffff00, fading dots)
```

### **Animations:**
```
✅ Anchors pulse (1s cycle)
✅ Stars rotate (3s cycle)
✅ Goal pulses (0.8s cycle)
✅ Spider rotates during flight
✅ Slingshot bands stretch
✅ Ropes fade when cut
✅ Stars zoom out when collected
✅ Completion screen bounces in
✅ Button hover effects
```

## 🎯 **GAMEPLAY STRATEGY**

### **Perfect 3-Star Run:**
1. Drag spider DOWN and LEFT (max power)
2. Aim toward first anchor
3. Release → Spider flies and auto-attaches
4. Let spider swing to collect first star
5. Click rope to cut when swinging toward second anchor
6. Auto-attaches to second anchor
7. Swing to collect second star
8. Cut and swing to third anchor
9. Collect third star
10. Cut final rope and reach goal!

### **Tips:**
- 🎯 **Aim high** for longer swings
- ⏱️ **Cut at swing peak** for maximum distance
- 🕸️ **Multiple ropes** = more control
- ⭐ **Stars are optional** but give satisfaction!
